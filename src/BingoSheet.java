// what I am thinking here is: BingoSheet takes a BingoNumber[][] 2d array. These numbers are then

public class BingoSheet {

    BingoNumber[][] bingoSheet;

    public BingoSheet(BingoNumber[][] bingoSheet) {
        this.bingoSheet = bingoSheet;
    }

    public void fillBingoSheet(){
        //write code to have BingoSheet be filled with BingoNumber/s based on what is in the file
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
            for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++){

            }
        }
    }
}
